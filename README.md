# Network Engineer Location Mapping

This project visualizes site-wise Network Engineer (NE) data on an interactive map using Tableau. It is designed to provide insights into the geographical distribution and site allocation of network engineers, aiding in efficient resource management and decision-making.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Map:** A dynamic visualization of network engineer locations tied to specific site IDs.
- **Site Data:** Displays detailed information about each site, including:
  - Site ID
  - Latitude & Longitude
  - Assigned Network Engineers
- **Insights:** Helps identify patterns or gaps in engineer distribution across sites.

## File Details

### `NE mapping master sheet.twbx`
This is the Tableau Packaged Workbook file that includes:

- All visualizations created for the project.
- Embedded data for site-wise Network Engineer mapping.

### Supporting Files (if applicable)
- **Screenshots:** Visual previews of key dashboards.
- **Source Data:** Cleaned and anonymized data sets for demonstration purposes.
- **Documentation:** Explanations of the methodology and insights derived from the project.

## How to Use

1. **Install Tableau Desktop:** Ensure you have Tableau Desktop installed on your system.
2. **Open the File:**
   - Download the `NE mapping master sheet.twbx` file.
   - Open it in Tableau Desktop.
3. **Interact with Visualizations:**
   - Explore the map to view site-wise details.
   - Adjust filters to analyze specific sites or engineer assignments.

## Use Cases

- **Resource Allocation:** Determine areas with high/low engineer density.
- **Strategic Planning:** Optimize engineer assignments based on geographical insights.
- **Presentation:** Share data-driven insights with stakeholders.
